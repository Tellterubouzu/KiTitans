"Viktor Arsenievich Nikolaev  (6 December 1893 – 25 September 1960) was a Russian and soviet geologist and petrologist. He was a specialist on the petrology and deep crustal structure of the Tien Shan region. The so-called ""Nikolaev Line"" is a fault that separates the northern and central Tien Shan ranges. 

Nikolaev was born in Nizhny Novgorod where his father Arseny Ivanovich was a store clerk married to Ekaterina Petrovna. After schooling in Novgorod, he joined the mining institute at St. Petersburg where he studied under E.S. Fedorov, V.V. Nikitin, K.I. Bogdanovich. He then worked on surveys in Pechory and worked on hydrology from 1914. In 1915 he worked in the northern Tien Shan range and he studied the volcanic strata which resulted in his thesis published ten years later. In 1917 he worked with N.G. Kassin surveying along the Murmansk rail line. He graduated in geology in 1918. In 1920 he became a geologist with the Geological Committee and surveyed in Turkestan along with V. N. Weber and D. I. Mushketov. They produced a geological map at the 1:420000 scale. His work on the Zeravshan River helped in irrigation of the Samarkand oasis. 
 
He examined faults in the Tien Shan region and helped in delineating tectonic zones. This separation has been called the ""Nikolaev line"". He also studied petrological processes and considered theoretical aspects of silicate formation under pressure and involving reactions with water and carbon dioxide.

"ロベール・ニコラ＝シャルル・ボクサ（Robert Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, 1789年8月9日 - 1856年1月6日）は、19世紀フランスの作曲家・ハープ奏者。波瀾万丈の生涯を送り、世界各地を転々とした。

生涯
1789年にモンメディで生まれる。神童ハープ奏者として活躍した後、1813年にナポレオン1世の宮廷楽団のハープ奏者に任命され、オペラの作曲に着手する。しかしながら1817年、通貨偽造や結婚詐欺（または重婚）、文書偽造への連坐により、告訴を免れるためにイングランドに逃亡。欠席裁判によって懲役刑が課された。

フランス法から無事に逃れてロンドンに上陸、1821年に王立音楽アカデミー開設に協力して学長を務めるが、1826年に前歴が発覚したため、辞職せざるを得なくなる。その後はロンドン王立劇場の音楽監督に就任している。

1839年に再びスキャンダルに関与、今度はオペラ作曲家ヘンリー・ビショップの夫人でオペラ歌手アンナ・リヴィエラと駆け落ちして、海外に逃亡したのである。ふたりは（フランス以外の）ヨーロッパやアメリカ合衆国で演奏活動を行い、1855年12月にゴールドラッシュに沸くシドニーに上陸した。しかし、オーストラリアでは1回しか演奏旅行を行うことができなかった。シドニーでボクサが急死したからである。アンナ・ビショップはシドニーのキャンパーダウン墓地に、彫刻をあしらったボクサの墓碑銘を贈っている。

"Cereceda de la Sierra is a municipality in the province of Salamanca, western Spain, part of the autonomous community of Castile-Leon. It is located  from the city of Salamanca and as of 2016 had a population of 75 people.

The vast majority of the population emigrated to other parts of Spain in the sixties and seventies but used to come back to his native land on summer holidays, most of them have a house in the village.

There is only one bar that agglutinates the shop and pub functions.

The romanic church, Ntra Sra del Rosario, and the Roman bridge called Puente Cantería, are the most important examples of the local architecture as well as the typical houses most of them rebuilt by the emigrants in the last twenty years.
There is a school building with a wall court behind to play typical Spanish sport as pelota with a racket or one hand and also to play traditional sport known as calva.
But the most popular game in this village is the tute, a popular card game which is played at the pubs all along the year and the losers occasionally have to paid the drinks that the winners consume as they are playing.

The local amateur football club is formed with the sons and grandsons of the local inhabitants that are proud of their parents and grandparents' land. It used to play a married-single match every year as part of the local summer celebrations.

"Cyprus–Israel relations refer to the bilateral relations between Cyprus and Israel. Israel has an embassy in Nicosia, while Cyprus has an embassy in Tel Aviv. Both countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean, United Nations, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.

Cyprus and Israel have extensive collaboration on military, cultural, and political matters. The prospect of a joint use of oil and gas fields off Cyprus, as well as EuroAsia Interconnector, now the world's longest subsea electric power cable have also brought the two countries closer together.

History

During and immediately after World War II, Cyprus became a transit point for Jewish Holocaust survivors trying to reach Mandate Palestine. Cyprus was then a British Crown Colony. From 1946 to 1949, an estimated 53,000 Jews were detained by the British in camps on Cyprus.

Today, relations between Cyprus and Israel are strong. Many Cypriots and Israelis refer to them as Cypriot-Israeli brotherhood. In September 2013, the leader of Democratic Rally Averof Neofytou called for supporting Israel as Cyprus's most reliable partner. Israeli President Shimon Peres called Cyprus Israel's most predictable neighbour.

Bilateral relations 
In the 1980s and 1990s, Cyprus expressed concern over Israel's then close defense relationship with Turkey. Cyprus outwardly backed the Palestinians in the Arab–Israeli conflict and officially recognizes Palestine as a de facto state. Cypriot first lady Androulla Vassiliou, wife of President George Vasiliou, was declared persona non grata in Israel when a delegation she was leading attempted to meet with Yasser Arafat, who was then under house arrest.

Relations began to improve in 1993. A number of bilateral agreements were signed and many official visits have taken place including the official State visit by the President of Israel and a reciprocate visit by the President of Cyprus.

In the early 2000s, members of the Cypriot branch of the Greek Orthodox Church were accused of selling church-owned land in the West Bank to Israeli developers.

In 2010, an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) was set within the territorial waters between Israel and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, a clarification essential for safeguarding Israel's rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs. The agreement was signed in Nicosia by Israeli Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau and the Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou. The two countries agreed to cooperate in the development of any cross border resources discovered, and to negotiate an agreement on dividing joint resources.

In February 2012, Netanyahu visited Cyprus, the first visit of an Israeli Prime Minister in history, and the two countries signed a search and rescue agreement. Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman visited Cyprus at the invitation of his Cypriot counterpart when Netanyahu was in Washington, and Lieberman has met with Cyprus foreign minister Kyprianou several times.

Energy and natural gas

Israeli energy firm Delek Group is seeking to work with Cyprus on natural gas exploration and extraction near the Leviathan gas field off the Israeli coast where Delek is already active. The large oil and gas field, and the opportunities of joint use, have brought the two countries closer together. This however has opened a new source of frictions between both countries and Turkey. Noble Energy, a US company, is also involved in the Leviathan field and this may lead to US government involvement in the gas fields dispute.

Turkey claimed that the Greek-Cypriot government in the southern part of the island did not have the authority to sign deals with Israel which could be detrimental to the Turkish-Cypriot population in Northern Cyprus. The discovery of oil fields in the Mediterranean allowed Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to continue his diplomatic confrontation on two fronts: one with Israel, and one with Cyprus.

Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias visited Israel in March 2011 for the first-ever official visit by a Cypriot head of state.
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Antonis Paschalides noted however that, despite all the enthusiasm, Cyprus could not ignore Israeli tourism and real estate projects in the island's north, which was under disputed Turkish control.

According to Turkish media reports in September 2011, Israel Air Force fighter planes flew through the airspace of both Cyprus and Northern Cyprus after taking off to face a Turkish seismic research ship in the Eastern Mediterranean. The reports added that Turkey responded by launching two fighters to track the Israeli planes, at which point the Israeli fighter jets returned to Israeli airspace. The Turkish research vessel was seen as a Turkish provocation in the dispute over gas fields. The operation of Israeli planes in Cyprus airspace was interpreted as a further sign of close Israel-Cyprus ties.

ΔΕΗ-Quantum Energy, a Cyprus-based group including Greece's state-controlled power utility Public Power Corporation of Greece (PPC, also known as DEH) is planning to lay the world's longest submarine power cable, linking Israel, Cyprus and Greece. The link, called the EuroAsia Interconnector project, would be the longest in the world. The cable is supposed to pass from Israel via Cyprus and Crete, and from there to mainland Europe notably Italy and Switzerland and from Bulgaria to Serbia.

During his visit in Israel in April 2013 Foreign Minister of  Cyprus has expressed his enthusiasm that as Cyprus has financial and economic problems, the energy cooperation agreement between Cyprus and Israel is a bright spot in that will boost hopes for a quick recovery by 2014.

In March 2021, Cyprus said that it had reached an agreement with Israel concerning the gas reserves in their maritime border. The Israeli side said that the two countries have set a framework that might solve the issue.

In May 2023, Cyprus and Israel were working on a deal to create a natural gas pipeline between the two countries, whereas Israeli natural gas would be liquified and exported to Europe. The American energy company Chevron is reportedly interested in the potential pipeline, which would be 320-kilometer (200-mile) in length and estimated to cost 450 million euros ($489 million), while the liquefaction plant would cost 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). The pipeline would take about two and a half years to build.

Cypriot mediation between Israel and Lebanon 
Since the establishment of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Cyprus, Israel and Lebanon, Cyprus has been offering  mediation between Lebanon and Israel over their maritime border dispute which was delaying gas and oil exploration of the two countries. General Director of the Department of Energy in Cyprus Solonas Kasinis announced in 2010 from Limassol that Cyprus does anything possible to strengthen cooperation between the three countries not only on the issue of the division of gas and oil reserves but also on military and strategic matters. In an effort to further settle the unstable situation between Israel and Lebanon, Chair President of Cypriot Parliament Yiannakis Omirou visited Lebanese President Michel Suleiman in Beirut to find solution to the disputes.

Tripartite energy memorandum
On August 8, 2013, Greece, Israel and Cyprus signed the tripartite energy memorandum of understanding after the completion of one year negotiation in Nicosia. Negotiations were held between the Energy and Water Resources Minister of Israel Silvan Shalom, the Cypriot minister of agriculture, natural resources and environment Nicos Kouyialis and the Cypriot minister of environment, energy and climate change George Lakkotrypis. The  2,000-mega-watt EuroAsia Interconnector is planned to lift Cyprus and Israel out of energy isolation through cheaper electricity as supported by George Lakkotrypis.
Silvan Shalom announced that the agreement is ""historic"" and that it demonstrated the powerful relations between the three countries adding that electricity will be exported to the European energy market via cable. The Greek Prime Minister at the time Antonis Samaras proclaimed on 8 August that Israel has a special role to play in supplying Europe with energy resources and supported that it can become a key energy hub.

Civil marriage 
Israeli matrimonial law is still based on the Millet system employed in the Ottoman Empire, which was not modified during the British Mandate and remains in force. Marriages in each religious community are under the jurisdiction of its own religious authority. Israeli couples who for any reason are unable or unwilling to contract a religious marriage often opt to get married in neighboring Cyprus, given that civil, interfaith and same-sex marriages entered into abroad are recognised by the Israeli state. Republic of Cyprus is ranked as the first or second destination for Israeli civil wedding, alongside Prague.

State visits to Cyprus
Israel and Cyprus agreed on the middle of February 2011 to launch a joint natural gas and oil exploration venture in their adjoining territorial waters. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Cypriot President Demetris Christofias inked the deal during Netanyahu's visit to Nicosia, which was the first by an Israeli leader ever.
The deal will also allow Israel to use Cyprus' air space and territorial waters for aerial and naval search and rescue drills.
The Prime Minister's Office said that the deal was part of the two nations' efforts to ""strengthen the improving ties between the two nations, as well as boost energy security in both countries.""
Netanyahu traveled to Cyprus with a mission of 20 high-level government officials, including Energy and Water Minister Uzi Landau and the directors of Israel's National Security and National Economic councils.

In April 2012 Foreign Minister made a three-day visit to Nicosia to discuss the gas-sharing agreement to exploit reserves that fall on the maritime boundary between the two countries. Lieberman later discussed the prospects of further expansion of cooperation between the two countries in the fields of energy, tourism and investment with Commerce and Industry Minister Neoclis Sylikiotis. Lieberman said relations between the two countries are probably at their best stage since the establishment of Cyprus and Israel.

On 2 September 2013 President of the Cypriot House of Representatives Yiannakis Omirou and the Knesset Speaker Yuli-Yoel Edelstein signed a protocol of cooperation between their countries' Parliaments. After the signing of the protocol Yiannakis Omirou expressed his enthusiasm for the setting up of a Cyprus-Israeli Friendship Group in the respective parliaments. Edelstein announced that the signing of the memorandum is a testament to the joint efforts and close cooperation between the two countries and will increase connection in the years to come. On 2 September 2013 the president of Democratic Rally, Averof Neophytou in a press conference in Nicosia characterised Israel as Cyprus' most reliable ally.

Economic relations

The Cypriot media report that the country could receive natural gas from Israel in early 2015, at reduced prices, if discussions on the supply of small quantities are completed by the end of the year, as the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Neoklis Sylikiotis has announced in a press conference about a visit to Israel by a high-ranking Cypriot delegation. The Cypriot government is seeking an interim energy solution until its own natural gas reserves can be developed. Minister Sylikiotis said that Israel is positive in supplying Cyprus a small quantity of natural gas, 0.5-0.7 billion cubic meters, for electricity production. He added that Cyprus would import Israeli gas in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) through contracts between Electricity Authority of Cyprus and Israel Electric Corporation (IEC).

Export proposals also include building a pipeline from Israel, Cyprus and finally to Greece or combining the gas from discoveries off Cyprus and Israel at a joint LNG plant as soon as 2018 that will be built in the southern city of Larnaca. Another option suggested by Noble was to build a plant in Jordan to ship the fuel to Asia through the Red Sea.

Cyprus-Israel Business Association
With the cooperation of both Cypriot and Israeli government in 2008 Cyprus-Israel Business Association was formed and is held annually in Nicosia, Cyprus. It headquarters in  Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry building and contacts Ministry of Finance of both Israel and Cyprus to coordinate an increase in financial bonds of the two countries. In the annual forum of Cyprus-Israel Business Association speakers from key positions from both countries take part. In September 2011 Chief Executive Officer of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ester Levanon visited Cyprus to present “The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as a reflection of the Israeli Economy”. Other prominent speakers include Ex-Ministers of Commerce and Trade Praxoulla Antoniadou Kyriacou and Antonis Paschalides, the President and the Secretary-General of the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry Manthos Mavrommatis, the President and the General Manager of the Cyprus Stock Exchange George Koufaris, the Ambassador of Israel Michael Harari and the Ambassador of Belgium Christakis Papavassiliou.

In 2013 Cyprus-Israel Business Association conferences took place in Jerusalem and even though the participants of 100 Israeli companies and the 30 Cypriot firms discuss how to increase cooperation in fields ranging “from milk to gas,” the main emphasis was on the Mediterranean natural resource that each of the countries has the potential to export. In May 2013 the President of the Israel-Cyprus Business Association Christakis Papavasilious announced “the new historic era” that Cyprus and Israel are entering together in regards to the economic aspect, and that both countries should rely on each other in order to push forward.

Electricity connection 

Electricity connection between Hadera of Israel and Vasilikos in Cyprus is one of the projects that will be funded by the European Union in the framework of the programme Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). According to a press release issued by the European Commission the amount earmarked for the Hadera Israel-Vasilikos Cyprus connection is approximately €1.325m. The project is based on an undersea cable for the connection of the electricity systems of Israel, Cyprus and Greece. Its capacity will be 2000 MW and its length approximately 1518 km. It will include three connections: 329 km between Israel and Cyprus, 879 km between Cyprus and Crete and 310 km between Crete and mainland Greece and will allow electricity transmission to both directions.

Military collaboration 
In October 2011 Phileleftheros newspaper published a document detailing a military exercise between Israel and Cyprus, which included mid-air refuelling of fighter jets and quick touchdown landings by Israel Air Force combat helicopters in Cyprus.
In 2013 Israel is expecting to receive approval from the Cypriot government to station military jets at the Andreas Papandreou airbase in the city of Paphos, creating the first Israeli military station outside the Israel. It is unknown if the plans include a permanent military presence on the island, with a full-time deployment of airmen.
In April 2013 it was reported that Israel was set to send warships to the eastern Mediterranean for a joint military exercise with the Republic of Cyprus. Cypriot Defense Minister Fotis Fotiou confirmed that the joint exercise, which will include the participation of four or five Israeli warships, would start on 25 April. Fotiou also noted that Cyprus will focus on the security of the eastern Mediterranean region and that of gas companies. On 9 April the Minister of Defence, Fotis Fotiou, met at his office with the Ambassador of Israel Michael Harari. In an official statement after the meeting Michael Harari expressed his view that Israel and Cyprus are determined to strengthen and deepen their relations in all areas in favor of their peoples and the region in general.
In early May 2013 Israel Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon and Cypriot Defence Minister Fotis Fitiou met in Tel Aviv to set the foundations for a coordinated cooperation in energy security issues. On his return to Cyprus, the Cyprus Defense Minister announced that during his meeting in Tel Aviv, they also decided to set up technical committees to promote the issues examined.
Moshe Ya'alon referred to the strategic relationship between the two countries and their benefit from the natural-gas field that lies between their shores. He added that Israel intends to improve the preparedness of its navy in the Mediterranean to protect the gas facilities of Israel and Cyprus.""

On 11 February 2014 between 11am and 1am Israel and Cyprus held a joint military exercise codenamed ‘Onisilos-Gideon’ in Cypriot FIR and the scheduled drill occurred inside the Nicosia flight information region (FIR). Israeli fighter jets carried out flybys over areas south of Limassol featuring 32 F15 and F16 jets and six more support aircraft of the Israeli Air Force, the exercise included simulated firing at targets on land and sea along the southern coast from Limassol to Paphos.

""Onisilos-Gideon"" October 2014
On 21 October 2014 Israel and Cyprus held joint military exercise that included aerial maneuvers by Israeli Air Force fighter jets in Cypriot airspace in collaboration with the Cypriot National Guard. Another part of the military drill took place in Cypriot territorial waters off the island of Crete.

Memorandum of Understanding
On 21 December 2011 Israeli minister of public security, Avi Dichter, with the Cypriot Minister of Interior Eleni Mavrou, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) ensuring the mutual protection and assistance between the two countries in the field of disaster management and civil protection. The MoU provides for collaboration and sharing practices on how to prepare the population for disasters and crises.

Environmental cooperation
A new desalination plant operates in Limassol, launched by the National Water Company Mekorot. The desalination plant has the capacity to produce up to  of desalinated potable water daily. At the inauguration of the plant in August 2013, there were present both President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades and Israeli Minister of Energy and Water Resources Silvan Shalom.
Cypriot Minister of Agriculture Nicos Kouyalis and Israel Minister of Energy and Water Resources Silvan Shalom met between 24 and 27 August 2013, during which they discussed issues pertaining to water development, management and protection based on the larger framework of the Memorandum of Understanding. There was high level of discussion at a technocratic level which is targeting at the further reinforcement of the cooperation and the exchange of experiences and knowledge, particularly relating to urban waste water treatment and the use of recycled water in agriculture.

Cyprus fires in June 2016
Cyprus on 18 June asked help from Israel after a fire was raging out of control in Argaka and other forest areas close to Evrychou which had approximately burned seventeen square kilometres of wild vegetation, hay and pine forest and could not be brought under control due to strong winds. Israel immediately sent three airtankers on 19 June, and an additional plane carrying 36 cubic meters of firefighting foam flew to the island on 20 June, per the Cypriot government request. Greece, Britain, Italy and France also sent helicopters and planes to aid in the firefighting efforts.

On 20 June Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the weekly Cabinet meeting announced he was pleased his country was able to extend assistance to Cyprus in order to put out the fire that broke out near Argaka and recalled that in 2010, during the massive Mount Carmel forest fire, the first person to contact for assistance was the president of Cyprus Demetris Christofias. Cyprus dispatched its only helicopter and plane to assist in the fire-fighting effort.

On 28 June Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades thanked from his bottom of his heart the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu in their telephone conversation.

Educational collaboration
In June 2016 Cyprus and Israel signed a programme of cooperation in the sectors of culture, education and science, for a period of three years (2016-2019), during an official visit of the Cypriot Minister of Education and Culture Costas Kadis to Israel. Cyprus Minister Costas Kadis visited Israel between 22 and 23 of June, at the invitation of his Israeli counterpart Naftali Bennett. During their meeting both Ministers emphasised the importance of strengthening the cooperation of the two countries in the field of education and especially in higher education. Naftali Benntett accepted the invitation of the Cypriot Minister to visit Cyprus with representatives of Universities and Research Centres of Israel to continue the dialogue and to identify areas of common interest for cooperation in higher education.

Cultural collaboration

With the initiative of Cyprus Ministry of Education a number of exchange programmes have been funded between Israeli and Cypriot students from years 12 to 18. The Israeli Yacht club and Famagusta District Sailing Club organised between 1–4 October 2012 the first ""Cyprus-Israel Regatta"" during which participants sailed from Larnaca to Tel Aviv. In August 2012 both countries signed a treaty to cooperate in forming a bank that will host the important amount of data which results from the numerous excavations that are conducted in both Israel and Cyprus. On 18 May 2013 Cypriot public was offered the opportunity to experience Israeli culture at the New Theatre Building of THOC in Nicosia through an exclusive series of cultural events and artistic happenings. Those who attended experienced some of Israel's best works of art, including theatre, children's puppet show, films and a photograph exhibition.

"『69 sixty nine』（シクスティ・ナイン）は、1987年に集英社から出版された村上龍の長編小説。1990年に集英社文庫、2004年に集英社から新装版の単行本、2007年に文春文庫からも刊行された。また2013年にはG2010からiBooksの電子書籍としてリリースされた。

1969年の長崎県佐世保市を舞台に、学校のバリケード封鎖、フェスティバルの開催など作者自身の実体験を基にした自伝的な青春小説である。当時の音楽や映画などの固有名詞が多く登場する。

作者は「これは楽しい小説である。こんなに楽しい小説を書くことはこの先もうないだろうと思いながら書いた。」と述べており、全編通して男子高校生の馬鹿馬鹿しくコミカルな思考や言動が描かれている。文章中のフレーズを極端に大きなフォントで強調するという手法が使われている。

2004年に主演妻夫木聡、脚本宮藤官九郎、監督李相日で映画化された。

あらすじ 
ベトナム戦争と学生運動に揺れる1969年、佐世保に住む高校三年生の矢崎剣介（ケン）は、同級生のマドンナ、""レディ・ジェーン""こと松井和子の気を惹くため、友人のアダマこと山田正らと共に校内の全共闘を言いくるめて、高校をバリケード封鎖しようと提案する。バリ封は成功し、ケンは仲間と達成感を味わうが、結局警察に犯行を突き止められ、ケンたちは停学処分となる。しかしその結果、松井和子たちと接近することに成功する。停学が明けたケンたちは、今度はフェスティバルの開催に向けて準備をすすめる。途中、長山ミエを誘ったことによって工業高校の番長に睨まれるも、友人の助けで窮地を脱し、フェスティバルは大成功を収める。

"テス川 (テスがわ、) とは、モンゴル国北西部及びロシア連邦トゥヴァ共和国を流れる河川。モンゴル語ではテス・ゴル、トゥヴァ語ではテス・ヘムと呼称される。

概要 
テス川はモンゴル国フブスグル県のツァガーン・ウール・ソムを源流とし、フブスグル県及びザブハン県を流れた後に北行してロシア領のトゥヴァ共和国南部を流れ、その後再びモンゴル国領に入ってウヴス・ヌールに流れ込む。また、テス川に架けられている橋にはフブスグル県の木製の橋や、ザブハン県バヤンテス・ソムのトゥヴァ共和国首都クズルへ向かう道の一部であるコンクリート製の橋などがある。

テス川流域は古くからトゥヴァ共和国領との繋がりが深く、モンゴル帝国が成立した13世紀にはともにオイラト部の領域にあった。15世紀、エセン・ハーンの下でオイラト部族連合は一時的にモンゴル高原を統一したが、エセンの死と同時にオイラトの支配は崩壊した。モンゴル年代記の一つ『シラ・トージ』によると、エセンの死後に即位したマルコルギス・ハーンは母親のサムル太后に連れられて「テス・ブルト(Tes Burutu)」でオイラト軍を撃ち破ったという。「テス・ブルト」とはテス川流域の何処かで、この時代においてもオイラト部の根拠地はテス川流域方面にあったものと推測されている。

"The Elizabeth River is a  tidal estuary forming an arm of Hampton Roads harbor at the southern end of Chesapeake Bay in southeast Virginia in the United States. It is located along the southern side of the mouth of the James River, between the cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Chesapeake. Forming the core of the Hampton Roads harbor, it is heavily supported by its tributaries which depend upon it.

Through its Southern Branch and the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, the Elizabeth River also is a gateway to points to the south for the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, an inland path from the ocean providing a more sheltered navigable waterway to Florida for commercial and recreational boating.

History 
The Elizabeth River was named by the Jamestown colonists in the early 17th century for Princess Elizabeth Stuart, She was the daughter of King James I of England and a sister of the later King Charles I, and his older brother, Henry Frederick, the ill-fated heir-apparent to the throne who died of typhoid fever as a teenager.

When the settlers aboard the three tiny ships of Captain Christopher Newport's 1607 voyage first discovered the great harbor of Hampton Roads a few days after reaching land at Cape Henry, they were seeking a pathway to the west to reach the ""Great Indies"" and soon sailed upriver along the largest and most likely westerly river, which they named the James (for their king), passing by the areas closest to the ocean as they sought a protected haven from other European forces such as the Spanish. Their settlement  inland at Jamestown was flawed in many other ways, but did meet the requirement of providing protection. Settlement along the Elizabeth River came a few years later.

During the U.S. Revolutionary War, Lord Dunmore and the British Royal Army sailed up the Elizabeth River and landed in Norfolk. The British Royal Army and the U.S. Continental Army then engaged at the Battle of Great Bridge on December 9, 1775. Upon British defeat, Lord Dunmore and his army withdrew onto four ships of the British Royal Navy, the Dunmore, the Liverpool, the Otter, and the Kingfisher. Under the command of Lord Dunmore, these ships patrolled along Norfolk's Elizabeth River waterfront and on New Year's Day 1776, began shelling Norfolk in what would later become known as the Burning of Norfolk.

During the War of 1812, two harbor fortifications located on opposite banks of the Elizabeth River were occupied to prevent the British from attacking Norfolk or Portsmouth. These defensive positions were Fort Norfolk, located on the eastern bank in Norfolk, and Fort Nelson, located on the western bank in Portsmouth. Neither of these forts saw action during the War of 1812. However, the men stationed at Fort Norfolk reinforced Craney Island, located at the mouth of the Elizabeth River, and took part in the Battle of Craney Island.

Geography 
The main branch of the estuary is approximately  long and is  wide at its mouth. It is formed by three primary branches, all tidal, known as the Eastern, Southern, and Western branches of the Elizabeth River, extending  into neighboring communities. The Western and Southern branches are partially fed by tributaries that originate within the Great Dismal Swamp.

Importance and use 
The Elizabeth River estuary and its tributaries provide significant military and commercial port facilities for Norfolk and Portsmouth, as well as a third major city, Chesapeake, which was formed by the voluntary political consolidation in 1963 of the small independent city of South Norfolk with much larger Norfolk County, which had long surrounded the other two large and expanding cities. The three cities surround the Elizabeth River and most of the area served by its three main branches. The Elizabeth River is the home of the oldest shipyard in the United States, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Founded as The Gosport Shipyard in 1767, the shipyard is still in use today having survived both the American Revolutionary and Civil wars and fires set to the shipyard within each conflict.

The river and its branches provide for both commerce and recreation activities. The Intracoastal Waterway connects to the greater Hampton Roads area through the Elizabeth River. They are of great importance to both commerce and the U.S. military considerations.

Environmental concerns
The Elizabeth River is a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay and faces significant environmental pollution challenges of its own that also hamper recovery in the Bay. The Elizabeth River's history with various industrial sites, such as dry docks, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, processing plants, and both sewage and storm water discharge contributed over time to the declining health of the river. In 1983, the EPA mentions 
the Elizabeth River was singled out as one of the most highly polluted bodies of water in the entire Bay watershed and as of 2011 remains one of the most polluted rivers on the United States east coast. Sediment contamination has made ""toxic hot spots"" within the Elizabeth River. Notably, the Southern Branch of the river at Money Point had become a 35-acre biological dead-zone with a nearly entirely lifeless river floor. Creosote (high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) from dumping and a major fire in 1963 played a major role in contaminating the river sediment there, which in some areas were as much as five feet thick.

The Commonwealth of Virginia entered into an agreement in 1995 after the Chesapeake Bay Program identified the Elizabeth River system as a ""Region of Concern"" in 1993. By 2003 a report entitled ""State of the River 2003"" by the Elizabeth River Project had been published, highlighting the sediment contamination in the Southern Branch along with other toxins including those causing cancer in some fish after a monitoring the river between 1999 and 2001. Efforts began in the 1990s and by 2003 bald eagles were returned to the watershed. 2008 saw the 3rd State Of The Elizabeth River report, prepared for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which finally provided data that most of the river was not suitable for swimming. At the same time, the report showed the most positive trends for improving levels of nutrients in Virginia compared to other areas of the Chesapeake Bay. In 2009, a pilot area was dredged at Money Point, replaced with clean sand, and restored with vegetation and artificial oyster reefs and in 2010 at least 17 species of fish and shellfish were found in the former toxic site where barely any life existed previously.
In 2011, dredging of the toxic sediment began, near Money Point as part of a larger initiative to help restore the Elizabeth River. Industries along the river are also voluntarily playing their part in restoring wetlands and oyster reefs in one of the largest restoration projects on the Chesapeake Bay.

Crossings 
Shipping has always been in competition with land-based transportation for crossings. Both activities are vital to the region.

Motor vehicles cross the main portion of the river using the Downtown Tunnel and the Midtown Tunnel. There are many other highway and railroad bridge crossings of the Eastern, Southern, and Western branches of the river of various ages and capacities, often with draw spans. The city of Chesapeake, with crossings of all three branches of the river by both railroads and highways of every type, and both bascule and swing-type draw spans, has the greatest number to contend with. In Chesapeake, the legal ownership and maintenance responsibilities are divided among the city, VDOT, and the railroads.  In November 2012, the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge (SNJB) opened, a public-private partnership that allows the builder to toll for 50 years.  The Bridge connects to Elm Avenue in Portsmouth and to Poindexter Street in Chesapeake.  The bridge has no toll booths and relies on VDOT EZ-Pass transponders for payment or sends bills based on photography of license plates.

"Ahlem Belhadj (1964 – 11 March 2023) was a Tunisian psychiatrist and women's rights campaigner. Serving at various times as president, chair, and director of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD), Belhadj campaigned for better treatment of women in Tunisia. She successfully fought for the right of women and children to apply for passports without permission of their husband or father. Belhadj led a march of thousands of women against President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali during the 2011 Tunisian Revolution. She was the 2012 winner of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize and placed 18th on Foreign Policys 2012 list of global thinkers.

Early life 
Belhadj grew up in Korba, one of five siblings. Her father was a teacher and mayor of the town for 20 years. A keen athlete, she won many school prizes and competed for the Korba and Stade Nabeulien teams as well as the national team in the long jump and 100m. Belhadj studied medicine at the Medicine School of Tunis where she decided to become a child psychiatrist.

Belhadj worked at the child and adolescent psychiatry department, Mongi Slim Hospital, University of Tunis El Manar. Ahlem performed research in autism, genetics, early intervention, and family intervention. Her second field of interest was the evaluation and psychotherapy of child psychotraumatism.

Later, she became interested in politics. She took part in her first political march on 8 March 1983 (International Women's Day) and there met her future husband Brik Zoghlami, a lawyer who was in a Marxist revolutionary group. 

Belhadj was married in 1993 and had two children. Her husband was forced to work in France due to the regime issuing an arrest warrant against him; he later served eight months in prison.

Tunisian Association of Democratic Women 
In 2004, Belhadj became president of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD). She continued to practice medicine and specialized in child psychiatry.

Belhadj was chair of the ATFD from 2011 to 2013 and campaigned for gender and social equality. Her interest in revolutionary politics began after enrolling in medicine school in Tunisia back in the 80's, when she participated in movements against Ben Ali's system, specially by defending women's rights and her freedom. During the Jasmine Revolution of 2011 she led marches of thousands of women against President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali; the revolution later led to the fall of Ali and Tunisia's first-ever democratic elections. 

Belhadj campaigned for new laws to be put in place against domestic violence. In 2015 amendments that she campaigned for brought about the freedom of women and children to apply for their own passports; previously they had to have the permission of their husband or father. She was director of the ATFD by 2014. After elections that brought Islamist parties into power, Belhadj became concerned about the resurgence of conservative Islamist policies. She also complained of the disruption of ATFD meetings by government officials in the name of preserving ""moral values"".

Described as the ""Arab Spring's Tunisian Heroine"", she won the Simone de Beauvoir Prize and placed 18th on Foreign Policys 2012 list of global thinkers.

Belhadj died on 11 March 2023, at age 59.

It is ritually burned as incense, and its seeds are a narcotic for Centauri when dropped in alcohol. The G'Quan Eth plant is ""difficult to grow, expensive to transport, very expensive to own."" Whether it affects other species in this way when in alcohol is not clear, but we know that Narn don't seem to use it as a recreational drug (Londo chides G'Kar for Narns ""It's a shame you Narns waste them, burning them as incense"") and that it is illegal to possess on B5 except in religious contexts. The plant is presumably named after Narn spiritual leader G'Quan.

Snake vine: an odd-looking vine with dusky, variegated leaves hunkered around a stem that winds a stranglehold around nearby trees, eventually killing them from the Sword of Truth fantasy series by Terry Goodkind. It will bite at nearby creatures, leaving deadly toothlike thorns that burrow into their skin and eventually kill them. There is actually a plant commonly called by this name that is native to Australia. See Snake vineSerenna veriformans: a fictional plant that appears in the novel and movie Jurassic Park. There has never been reported a prehistoric fern genus named Serenna or a veriformans species. The word vermiform usually refers to something that is worm-like, like in Vermiform appendix. In the movie the plant is not a fern but an angiosperm.
Sukebind: fictional flower in the novel Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons.
Tesla trees: large electrified trees from the planet Hyperion in Hyperion Cantos novels by Dan Simmons.

In J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series

 Bowtruckle
 Leaping toadstool
Gillyweed: seaweed-like plant which, when you eat it, allows you to breathe underwater for a short period of time. You also temporarily grow fins and flippers.
Gurdyroot: resembles a green onion. Basis for a foul-tasting purple infusion brewed by the Lovegoods in order to fend off Gulping Plimpies. Considered not very original by Charles Elliott, depending on a funny name for effect.
Mandrakes: tubers that look like babies when young. Their screams can kill when fully grown. A potion made from mature mandrakes can restore victims who have been petrified. A different kind of mandrake is a real plant. Whilst the mandrake as it appears in the books and films is fictional, J. K. Rowling's description does reflect genuinely held beliefs about the mandrake, in particular, the danger surrounding its screams. This led to the practice of using dogs to collect the mandrake and the blocking of ears during collecting.
The whomping willow: a tree which has club-like branches which can move. The whomping Willow is very hostile in the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets book; Harry Potter and Ron Weasley crash into it with a car, and are lucky to escape alive. There is a secret passage that leads into the Shrieking Shack, a haunted house, underneath the whomping Willow's roots.

In Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere Series 

On the planet Roshar (The Stormlight Archive)

 Firemoss: A red-brown moss that, when activated by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger, releases wisps of smoke that create feelings of euphoria when inhaled and is used as a recreational drug. Firemoss is highly addictive, limiting its medicinal use, though it is sometimes used to reduce cranial swelling and offer pain relief.
 Knobweed: Like most of the plants found on Rohsar, knobweed has adapted to survive the planet's harsh storms. The reed-like stalk anchors itself directly to stone and the frond found at the top of the stalk has the ability to contract and retreat into the stalk during storms for protection. Knobweed reproduces by releasing fluffy pappuses that carry seeds into the air. The milky white sap found inside knobweed stems is a natural and highly valuable antiseptic used in the field and by established apothecaries.
 Prickletac: Prickletac plants are actually colonies of much smaller living buds. As each generation of buds dies it converts to a hard, stony material which the next generation builds upon. Prickletac's reproductive system is based on this oddity – when a 'limb' grows too large it breaks off and falls to the ground, scattering living buds. Also known as Twisted Spine.
 Rockbuds: Rockbud is both a general term for several shelled plants on Roshar, including Lavis Polyps, Vinebuds, and Prickletac Shrubs, and the proper name for a specific plant. The true Rockbud plant is a shelled plant containing lengthy tendrils that reach out to lap up water (and occasionally animal blood). The size of fully grown rockbuds depends largely on climate. In colder climates they grow no larger than a human fist, while rockbuds in warm climates can grow to the size of a barrel. Rockbuds are harvested for consumption, limited medicinal uses, and paper making.
 Shalebark: A class of stony, fanlike plants often used for decoration and landscaping.

On the planet Nalthis (Warbreaker)

 Tears of Edgli: Vibrantly colored flowers that grow only in the temperate T'Telir climate. Highly valuable both economically and magically.

On the planet First of the Sun (Sixth of the Dusk);

 Unnamed Telepathic Trees: Many flora and fauna on this planet communicate with a form of natural telepathy. Certain unnamed plants living on the islands that make up the Pantheon send false thoughts of wounded or frightened animals to attract predators, which often fight and leave victims dead near enough to the tree to provide nutrition. These plants are not directly carnivorous.

On the planet Taldain (White Sand Series)

 Dorim vines: Dorim vines live under the sand that covers most of Taldain's Dayside continent, reaching down to the water table where they fill themselves with water as a defensive mechanism against predators – the hard shells of many of the continents animals is dissolved by contact with water. Pouring water onto sand draws nearby vines out of the ground.

In Dungeons & Dragons
The role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has a number of imaginary, according to Charles Elliott ""not-very-ingenious"", plant species, as well as ""a taxonomy of fungal horrors"", which Ben Woodard considers eerie not only for their poisonous nature, but because many have the ability to move.

Basidirond: a giant multi-stemmed fungus creature
Hangman tree: a tree that will attempt to strangle anyone who ventures under it
Kelpie: a shape-shifting mass of animate seaweed that can imitate a woman or other creatures, and drowns its victims
Myconid: A ""race of [man-sized] sentient fungus creatures"", ""some of which pack a mean punch"", and which have the ""ability to spray poisons that can disable their foes"".
Oaken defender: an enormous disk-shaped plant that lives in dryad groves and assists in their defense
Obliviax: ""memory moss"", a black moss that steals memories from intelligent creatures
Phantom fungus: a dangerous subterranean plant that grapples victims with tentacles
Shambling mound: an atrocious plant-like creature, also called a shambler
Shrieker: Ambulatory fungus, which ""can be used as cheap alarm systems for Underdark societies, but they possess no combat abilities of their own. The only thing a shrieker can do is shriek"". Scott Baird from Screen Rant ranked the man-sized shrieker among the weakest monsters in the game.
Tendriculos: an enormous, savage, sentient plant resembling a huge, tangled shrubbery
Treant: sentient trees with human characteristics that typically protect forests from antagonists
Vegepygmy: a ""mold man"", a former human transformed by russet mold
Wood woad: a creature resembling big, burly, bestial men made entirely of wood and bark bearing, but without foliage
Yellow musk creeper: a creeping plant that drains the intelligence of its victims, killing them or turning them into ""yellow musk zombies"" under the plant's control

In Monty Python's Flying Circus
The following plants appear in the David Attenborough sketch of the last Monty Python episode.
 Angolan sauntering tree (Amazellus robin ray).
 Gambian sidling bush.
 Puking Tree of Mozambique.
 The Turkish little rude plant.
 Walking tree of Dahomey (Quercus nicholas parsonus).

In the 2009 film Avatar
Plants in Pandora have evolved according to the characteristics of their environment, which has an atmosphere that is thicker than on Earth, with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, xenon and  hydrogen sulfide. Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.

In video games
Video games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters.

 The Monster Hunter series has multiple fictional flowers and plants that can be gathered by the player character, including nulberries, might seeds, flowferns, and dragonstrike nuts.
The titular plants from the Plants vs. Zombies series, which are used to defeat zombie enemies.

The series also contains the Great Deku Tree, a guardian tree that watches over the forest in multiple games in the franchise.
Broc Flower: a plant in Fallout: New Vegas used as a medical remedy.
Plantera: a flower from the game Terraria which is used to be a two phase bossfight, when it is at 51% health and higher it is in its first phase moving towards the player and firing seeds, but when the player decreases its life to 50% it enters phase two, bursting a mouth with many sharp teeth, spawning biters and spores.

In DC comics
The Black Mercy is an extraterrestrial hallucinogenic plant used a weapon by the supervillain Mongul. Mongul first uses it in ""For the Man Who Has Everything"", a story by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons that was first published in Superman Annual #11 (1985). The story was later adapted into the Justice League Unlimited episode of the same name. Supergirl has an episode called ""For the Girl Who Has Everything"", where in this version the plant was sent by Kryptonian Non. The story also served as an inspiration for the episode of Krypton, ""Mercy"", where in this version the plant was put on Lyta-Zod by her son from the future, General Zod. Described in the original story by Mongul as ""something between a plant and an intelligent fungus"", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of symbiosis, and feeds from the victim's ""bio-aura"". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of ""shrugging off"" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling to do so unaided.

The Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like stigma, growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely. Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though Oliver Queen and Hal Jordan are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what Hal believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.

In the video game Injustice 2, Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant.

Characters who have experienced the Black Mercy include:
Superman sees himself on a still-intact Krypton with his biological parents, married to a retired actress named Lyla, and a son named Van. 
Batman envisions a life in which his parents were not murdered during his childhood, and he is married to Kathy Kane.
Mongul envisions a life in which he successfully kills Superman, before setting out across the universe, killing all of his enemies, entire populations kneeling before him amid his destruction of countless galaxies.
Green Arrow envisions a life in which he is married to Sandra ""Moonday"" Hawke, and in addition to their older son Connor, they have a younger son, and a newborn third. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Green Arrow was caught along with Hal Jordan, with the result that he saw what Hal believed would be his perfect life.
Hal Jordan envisions a life in which his parents and his siblings are present in his life, and Sinestro is a friend who fights by his side as a member of the Green Lantern Corps. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what he believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it.

"The World Day of Prayer is an international ecumenical Christian laywomen's initiative. It is run under the motto “Informed Prayer and Prayerful Action,” and is celebrated annually in over 170 countries on the first Friday in March. The movement aims to bring together women of various races, cultures and traditions in a yearly common Day of Prayer, as well as in closer fellowship, understanding and action throughout the year.

History
The Women's World Day of Prayer started in the US in 1887 when Mary Ellen Fairchild James, wife of Darwin Rush James from Brooklyn, New York, called for a day of prayer for home missions, and Methodist women called for a week of prayer and self-denial for foreign missions. Two years later, two Baptists called together a Day of Prayer for the World Mission. The Day of Prayer initiated by these two women expanded to Canada in 1922, then to the British Isles in the 1930s. The movement's focus on ecumenism and reconciliation led to growth after World War II. Since 1927 the day of prayer in the month of March has been known as the Women's World Day of Prayer. Catholic women joined the movement after the Second Vatican Council, beginning in 1967, and united what had been their May day of prayer with the March Women's World Day of Prayer in 1969. As such, Catholic women honor the World Day of Prayer.

Two other Christian denominations celebrate a World Day of Prayer in September. Firstly, the Unity Church, a New Thought denomination headquartered at Unity Village, Missouri celebrates a twenty-four-hour World Day of Prayer, principally on the second Thursday in September (member churches may start at sunset on September 11, and the themes differ from those of the Women's World Day of Prayer set forth below). And secondly, the terrorist events of September 11, 2001 prompted the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal order, to designate that date annually as a World Day of Prayer for Peace.

Aims
Through the  World Day of Prayer, women are encouraged  to become aware of the other countries and cultures and no longer live in isolation. They are also encouraged take up the burdens of other people, to sympathize with the problems of other countries and cultures and pray with and for them. They are further encouraged to become aware of their talents and use them in the service of society. The World Day of Prayer aims to demonstrate that prayer and action are inseparable and that both have immeasurable influence in the world.

Programme
Every year, worship service focuses on a different country and a specific theme. World Day of Prayer National/Regional Committees of that country prepare the order of worship on these themes  to be used on the next World Day of Prayer.

On the first Friday of March, then, in services all over the world that country becomes the focus of prayer and understanding. Through preparation and participation in the worship service, women worldwide learn how their sisters of other countries, languages and cultures understand the biblical passages in their context. They learn of the concerns and needs of those women and to empathize and feel in solidarity with them.

"Cryptoconchus porosus, the butterfly chiton, is a species of chiton, a marine polyplacophoran mollusc in the family Acanthochitonidae.

Description
Cryptoconchus porosus is a large chiton reaching a length of about . The eight valves are almost completely covered by a raised girdle, young specimens may have only seven. These are pale blue or white on top, sometimes sky blue underneath, and when removed from the animal they each resemble a butterfly giving the common name. The girdle is fleshy and smooth with short sutural bristles that protrude from 18 rounded pores, which are elevated and run in two crested rows from head to tail. The colour of the dorsal surface can range from dark brown to bright orange, while the underside of the girdle is pale orange with a bright orange foot.

Distribution and habitat
Cryptoconchus porosus is native to New Zealand, and present in Madagascar. These common grazers prefer outer exposed rocks washed by waves, in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal zone, or in deeper water down to 30m, often in association with sponges.

"The National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, Scotland, was formed in 2006 with the merger of the new Museum of Scotland, with collections relating to Scottish antiquities, culture and history, and the adjacent Royal Scottish Museum (opened in 1866 as the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, renamed in 1904, and for the period between 1985 and the merger named the Royal Museum of Scotland or simply the Royal Museum), with international collections covering science and technology, natural history, and world cultures. The two connected buildings stand beside each other on Chambers Street, by the intersection with the George IV Bridge, in central Edinburgh. The museum is part of National Museums Scotland. Admission is free.

The two buildings retain distinctive characters: the Museum of Scotland is housed in a modern building opened in 1998, while the former Royal Museum building was begun in 1861 and partially opened in 1866, with a Victorian Venetian Renaissance facade and a grand central hall of cast iron construction that rises the full height of the building, design by Francis Fowke and Robert Matheson. This building underwent a major refurbishment and reopened on 29 July 2011 after a three-year, £47 million project to restore and extend the building led by Gareth Hoskins Architects along with the concurrent redesign of the exhibitions by Ralph Appelbaum Associates.

The National Museum incorporates the collections of the former National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. As well as the national collections of Scottish archaeological finds and medieval objects, the museum contains artefacts from around the world, encompassing geology, archaeology, natural history, science, technology, art, and world cultures.  The 16 new galleries reopened in 2011 include 8,000 objects, 80 per cent of which were not formerly on display.  One of the more notable exhibits is the stuffed body of Dolly the sheep, the first successful cloning of a mammal from an adult cell. Other highlights include Ancient Egyptian exhibitions, one of Elton John's extravagant suits, the Jean Muir Collection of costume and a large kinetic sculpture named the Millennium Clock. A Scottish invention that is a perennial favourite with school parties is the Scottish Maiden, an early beheading machine predating the guillotine.

In 2019, the museum received 2,210,024 visitors, making it Scotland's most popular visitor attraction that year.

History

Royal Museum of the University
In 1697 Robert Sibbald presented the University of Edinburgh College of Medicine with a natural history collection he had put together with his friend Andrew Balfour, who had recently died. The wide range of specimens was put on permanent display in the university, as one of the first museums in the UK. Daniel Defoe, in A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain published in 1737, called it ""a fine Musæum, or Chamber of Rarities, which are worth seeing, and which, in some things, is not to be match'd in Europe"". Later editions of the book said it had rarities not to be found in the Royal Society or the Ashmolean Museum. In 1767 the museum became the responsibility of the first Regius Professor of natural history, Robert Ramsey, then in 1779 his successor John Walker recorded that he had found the collection was in poor condition.

The Regius Professorship, and the museum, was taken over in 1804 by Robert Jameson, a mineralogist whose course covered zoology and geology, who built it up ""not a private department of the university but as a public department connected in some degree with the country of Scotland"". In 1812 it was renamed the ""Royal Museum of the University"". An enormous number of specimens were acquired, by buying from other collections and by encouraging travellers abroad to collect and preserve their finds. Packages were delivered duty free, and half of the specimens collected by Royal Navy survey ships went to the museum (the other half going to the British Museum in London). Jameson's natural history course held practical classes three times a week in ""the great museum he had collected for illustrating his teaching"", including description of exhibits and identification of mineral specimens. With support from the University Authorities, Edinburgh Town Council and the Commissioners for the College Buildings, a new museum was built in 1820 as part of new university buildings (the museum is now occupied by the Talbot Rice Gallery, its main features still in place). The taxidermist John Edmonstone undertook work for the museum, and in 1826 gave private lessons to Charles Darwin, who later studied in the museum and befriended its curator, the ornithologist William MacGillivray.

The collections, noted as ""second only to those of the British Museum"", overfilled the available space. In 1852 Jameson suggested proposals, which were put forward by the university Senatus, that the natural history collections be taken over by the government to form a new National Museum adjacent to the university, and integrated into it. Jameson was seriously ill during this time, and died on 19 April 1854, shortly after the negotiated agreement was formalised.

Chambers Street Museum
For a few years after the museum first opened, its frontage looked on to a narrow lane. In the 1870s this lane was widened in forming Chambers Street. Over the following century, though there were official names, it became popularly known as the ""Chambers Street Museum"".

Industrial Museum of Scotland
The site for building, bought earlier to ensure unobstructed light to the university buildings, had been occupied by two properties west of Jameson's museum; an Independent Chapel with seats for 1,000 fronting West College Street, and the Trades' Maiden Hospital girls' school beside Argyle Square. The grounds of these buildings were bounded on the north by a narrow lane connecting North College Street to the square, and on the south by the Flodden Wall.

In 1854, the government chose to transfer the university's collection into an enlarged natural history museum combined with a new institution educating the public about commerce and industrial arts. It established the Industrial Museum of Scotland under the direction of the Board of Trade's Science and Art Department in London, and approved purchase of the site. The brief was to emulate The Museum of Practical Geology of ""London, but embracing, in addition, the economic products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms"". The general director of the museum would be responsible to the Board. The university's Regius Professor of natural history continued as Keeper of its collection, with access to specimens to illustrate lectures, and also reported directly to the Board. In 1855 George Wilson was appointed as the museum's first director, he pressed ahead with preparations while the Board of Works organised designs, but died in 1859. Thomas Croxen Archer was appointed director on 10 May 1860, and the Industrial Museum (Scotland) Act 1860 was passed on 28 August.
Design work was carried out by Captain Francis Fowke, Engineer and Artist of the Science and Art Department, and architect Robert Matheson of the Office of Works in Edinburgh. Contract documents were signed in May 1861, and construction began. In ceremonies on 23 October 1861, Prince Albert laid the foundation stone of the General Post Office on Waterloo Place, then the foundation stone of the museum. This was his last public appearance before his death six weeks later.

Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art
The institution became the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art in 1864, with two divisions; Natural History, and Industrial Arts. The natural history collection was transferred from the university in 1865–1866. Prince Alfred formally opened the first phase on 19 May 1866, with public access to the east wing and about a third of the Great Hall (now the Grand Gallery). A temporary wall formed the west gable of this space, displays in it included models and machinery of architecture, military and civil engineering, including lighthouses. A small hall (now Living Lands) accommodated manufactures. The natural history collection took up the large hall in the east wing (now Animal World), a corridor link to the university formed a ""Bridge of Sighs"" over West College Street. On the western half of the site, ""old buildings"" which had formed Argyll Square were in temporary use for agricultural and educational exhibits.

George Allman became Regius Professor and Keeper of the natural history collection in 1855. Issues developed over access to specimens for teaching, particularly when some were lost, and he apparently neglected curation. Wyville Thomson took over in 1870, and the Board of Trade redefined duties, but curation was not his priority. For a reception in the Spring of 1871, the museum stored refreshments in the ""Bridge of Sighs"" corridor, but students found this and no drinks were left for the Edinburgh worthies, so a door restricted access from the university. Wyville Thomson went on the Challenger expedition for four years. The museum severed ties with the university in 1873, and appointed Ramsay Traquair as its Keeper of the Natural History Collections. The bridge was closed (at some time later it was reopened and for a while prior to the museum's temporary closure during World War II it provided limited access between the museum and University). The university had lost use of the museum specimens, so started a replacement teaching collection in its old museum space. This became intolerably cramped, eventually James Hartley Ashworth raised funds and a new teaching laboratory and museum was opened in 1929 at the King's Buildings campus.

In 1871 work began on widening the street to the north of the university and museum to form Chambers Street, linked to George IV Bridge. The central section of the Museum of Science and Art building, including the rest of the Great Hall, was completed in 1874 and formally opened to the public on 14 January 1875. The west wing was completed in 1888, rooms were opened to the public when they were fitted out, until the last one opened on 14 October 1890.

Royal Scottish Museum

Administration of the museum was transferred in 1901 from the Science and Art Department to the Scottish Education Department, and in 1904 the institution was renamed the Royal Scottish Museum.

Electricity was introduced, replacing the original gas lighting, and powering the first interactive displays in the museum: push-button working models, starting with a marine steam engine and a sectioned steam locomotive.
During the period 1871 to 1911 much of the day-to-day running of the museum was undertaken not by the director, but by the curator.

The Royal Scottish Museum displayed prank exhibits on April Fool's Day on at least one occasion. In 1975, a fictitious bird called the Bare-fronted Hoodwink (known for its innate ability to fly away from observers before they could accurately identify it) was put on display.  The exhibit included photos of blurry birds flying away.  To make the exhibit more convincing, a mount of the bird was sewn together by a taxidermist from various scraps of real birds, including the head of a carrion crow, the body of a plover, and the feet of an unknown waterfowl.  The bare front was composed of wax.

Royal Museum of Scotland
In 1985 the museum was renamed the Royal Museum of Scotland, and its administration came under the newly formed National Museums Scotland, along with the Museum of Antiquities which in 1998 moved to a new building constructed as an extension to the Royal Museum at the west end of Chambers Street.

National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland
The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was founded in 1780. It still continues, but in 1858 its collection of archaeological and other finds was transferred to the government as the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and from 1891 it occupied half of a new building in Queen Street in the New Town, with its entrance hall shared with the Scottish National Portrait Gallery which occupied the other half.

Museum of Scotland
The organisational merger of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Museum took place in 1985, but the two collections retained separate buildings until 1995 when the Queen Street building closed, to reopen later occupied solely by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. In 1998 the new Museum of Scotland building opened, adjacent to the Royal Museum  of Scotland building, and connected to it. The masterplan to redevelop the Victorian building and further integrate the architecture and collections was launched in 2004. The split naming caused confusion to visitors, and in 2006  permission was granted to remove ""Royal"" to achieve a unified brand.

Merger – present day
On 2006 the two museums were formally merged as the National Museum of Scotland. The naming had been changed for practical reasons, including strategy and marketing. The old Chambers Street Museum building closed for redevelopment in 2008, before reopening in July 2011.

Staff at the museum took several days of strike action at points during 2015 and 2016, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union.

Architecture

Royal Scottish Museum building
Construction was started in 1861 and proceeded in phases, the eastern sections opened in 1866 before others had even begun construction. The full extent of the original design was completed in 1888. It was designed by civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, Engineer and Artist of the Science and Art Department in London who was also responsible for the Royal Albert Hall, and architect Robert Matheson of the Office of Works in Edinburgh. The exterior, designed in a Venetian Renaissance style, contrasts sharply with the light-flooded main hall or Grand Gallery, inspired by The Crystal Palace.

Numerous extensions at the rear of the building, particularly in the 1930s, extended the museum greatly.  1998 saw the opening of the Museum of Scotland (now the Scottish History and Archaeology department), linked internally to the main building. The major redevelopment completed in 2011 by Gareth Hoskins Architects uses former storage areas to form a vaulted Entrance Hall of  at street level with visitor facilities. This involved lowering the floor level by . Despite being a Class A listed building, it was possible to add lifts and escalators. The accessible entrance is at the corner tower of the Scottish History and Archaeology building.

Museum of Scotland (Scottish History and Archaeology) building
The building is made up of geometric, Corbusian forms, but also has numerous references to Scotland, such as brochs and castellated defensive architecture.  It is clad in golden Moray sandstone, which one of its architects, Gordon Benson, has called ""the oldest exhibit in the building"", a reference to Scottish geology.  The building was a 1999 Stirling Prize nominee.

Collections
The galleries in the newer building present Scottish history in an essentially chronological arrangement, beginning at the lowest level with prehistory to the early medieval period, with later periods on the higher levels.  The Victorian building, as reopened in 2011, contains four zones (each with numerous galleries), covering natural history, world cultures (including galleries on the South Pacific, East Asia, and Ancient Egypt), European art and design, and science & technology.  The Grand Gallery contains a variety of large objects from the collections, with a display called the ""Window on the World"" rising through four storeys, or about , containing over 800 objects reflecting the breadth of the collections.  Beyond the Grand Gallery at ground level is the ""Discoveries"" gallery, with objects connected to ""remarkable Scots ... in the fields of invention, exploration and adventure"". Notable artifacts include:

 Assyrian relief of King Ashurnasirpal II and a court official
 Monymusk Reliquary
 St Ninian's Isle Treasure
 11 of the Lewis chessmen.  (The rest are owned by the British Museum)
 Celtic brooches, including the Hunterston Brooch

"London Levi Fletcher-Baker (born May 19, 1975) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for 16 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the St. Louis Rams, Buffalo Bills, and Washington Redskins. He played college football at John Carroll and signed with Rams as an undrafted free agent in 1998. After four seasons with the Rams, he was a member of the Bills for five seasons and spent his last seven seasons with the Redskins. He made four Pro Bowls during his Redskins tenure and won a Super Bowl title with the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.

Fletcher was recognized for never missing a game in his career, being one of only five players in NFL history to play in over 250 consecutive games and holding the record for consecutive starts at the linebacker position. He finished his career with 215 consecutive games started, which ties him for seventh all-time along with Alan Page and Ronde Barber. He was named to the Washington Ring of Fame in 2019 and joined their radio broadcast crew in 2022.

High school years
Fletcher attended Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School in Cleveland, Ohio, and won varsity letters in football and basketball. He played on two state championship basketball teams.

College years
While attending John Carroll University, Fletcher played both basketball and football for the John Carroll Blue Streaks. As a senior, he had 202 tackles (a school-record) and was named the Division III National Linebacker of the Year. Fletcher also attended Saint Francis University of Pennsylvania before transferring to John Carroll University. He was on the men's basketball team while at Saint Francis.

Professional career
Fletcher attended the NFL Scouting Combine and ran a 4.38 in the 40-yard dash. He worked out for several NFL teams and was expected to be a day 2 selection, but was not one of the 30 linebackers drafted during the 1998 NFL Draft.

Fletcher was known by his nickname - dot.com - because he was 'always online with the other team.'

St. Louis Rams

1998
On April 28, 1998, the St. Louis Rams signed Fletcher to a one-year, $158,000 contract as an undrafted free agent.
He made his professional regular season debut in the St. Louis Rams’ season-opening 24–17 loss against the New Orleans Saints. On December 27, 1998, Fletcher earned his first career start after Eric Hill sustained an injury. He made eight solo tackles on defense and seven special teams tackles as the Rams lost 38–19 at the San Francisco 49ers in a Week 17. Fletcher earned the Rams Rookie of the Year Award. He finished the season with 14 combined tackles (11 solo) in 16 games and one start.

1999
Throughout training camp, Fletcher competed against Charlie Clemons and Lorenzo Styles to be the starting middle linebacker after the Rams chose not to re-sign Eric Hill. Head coach Dick Vermeil named Fletcher the starting middle linebacker to begin the regular season, alongside outside linebacker Todd Collins and Mike Jones.

On October 3, 1999, Fletcher collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (nine solo) and made his first career sack during a 38–10 win at the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3. Fletcher sacked Bengals’ quarterback Jeff Blake for a ten-yard loss during the third quarter. In Week 9, Fletcher recorded five combined tackles and earned his first career safety during a 31–27 loss at the Detroit Lions. Fletcher earned his safety by tackling running back Greg Hill in the endzone for a one-yard loss during the first quarter. Fletcher started in all 16 games in 1999 and recorded a total of 138 tackles on defense and special teams combined. His 138 tackles were the most by a Ram since Roman Phifer collected 149 tackles in the 1995. Fletcher recorded 90 combined tackles (66 solo), with three sacks, and one safety on defense.

The St. Louis Rams finished first in the NFC West with a 13–3 record and earned a first round bye. On January 16, 2000, Fletcher started in his first career playoff game and recorded 11 combined tackles (eight solo) and made one sack during a 49–37 victory against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Divisional Round. The following week, he made nine combined tackles as the Rams defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 11–6 in the NFC Championship Game. On January 30, 2000, Fletcher started in Super Bowl XXXIV and recorded 11 combined tackles (nine solo) as the Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans 23–16. He also was named to the All-Madden team and as a second alternate to the Pro Bowl for the first time.

2000
On February 2, 2000, St. Louis Rams’ head coach Dick Vermeil announced his decision to retire. The St. Louis Rams promoted offensive coordinator Mike Martz to head coach. Martz retained Fletcher, Collins, and Jones as the starting linebackers. He started in the St. Louis Rams’ against the Denver Broncos and collected a season-high 14 combined tackles (nine solo) and made two sacks during their 41–36 victory. On November 12, 2000, Fletcher made six solo tackles, forced a fumble, and made his first career interception during a 38–24 at the New York Giants in Week 11. Fletcher intercepted a pass by Giants’ Kerry Collins, that was intended for wide receiver Ike Hilliard, and returned it for a 12-yard gain during the third quarter. In Week 13, Fletcher recorded seven combined tackles, was credited with half a sack, and made a season-high two interceptions during a 31–24 loss against the New Orleans Saints. He made both interceptions off pass attempts by Saints’ quarterback Aaron Brooks. In Week 15, he recorded ten combined tackles (nine solo) and two sacks during a 40–29 victory against the Minnesota Vikings. His performance earned him NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. He led the team with 193 tackles on defense and special teams, eclipsing the old franchise mark of 185 set by LB Jim Collins in 1984. Fletcher recorded 132 combined tackles (105 solo) solely  on defense and made four interceptions and 5.5 sacks in 16 games and 15 starts.

2001
In 2001, Fletcher earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors twice and was an alternate to the pro bowl for the third straight season. In a game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 23, he led the team with a career-high 21 tackles, 15 solo. The second time was after his big performance against the New England Patriots on November 18 as he led the team with 17 tackles with one pass deflection. He forced a fumble on the Rams’ three-yard line that led to a 97-yard scoring drive to end the first half and intercepted a Tom Brady pass with 5:18 left in the third quarter for an 18-yard return. This season, the Rams made the Super Bowl XXXVI but were defeated by the Patriots 20–17, after kicker Adam Vinatieri made a game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired.

Buffalo Bills
On March 6, 2002, the Buffalo Bills signed Fletcher to a five-year, $17.12 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $4 million.

Starting in 2002, Fletcher started all 16 regular season games for the Bills until his last season in 2006, when he recorded a team-high 157 tackles, including nine for loss, set a career-high with 14 deflections and tied a career-high with four interceptions. On September 10, in the first regular season game, Fletcher scored his first career touchdown after recovering a fumble by the Patriots' Tom Brady and returning it five yards for a touchdown only 12 seconds into the game. Fletcher was named a 2007 Pro Bowl alternate in his last season as a member of the Bills.

Washington Redskins

On March 2, 2007, Fletcher signed with the Washington Redskins to a five-year, $25 million contract. He immediately became the team's starting middle linebacker. With his first season on the team, he was named co-winner of the B.J. Blanchard Award, an honor given annually to a Redskins player who best helps the local media do their jobs, along with quarterback Jason Campbell. Fletcher continued his Pro Bowl-caliber run with the Redskins in 2008.

He was the Redskins' defensive co-captain for the team from 2008 season until he retired. Also in 2008, the Redskins nominated Fletcher as their Walter Payton Man of the Year Award representative.

Fletcher was named to the NFC squad in the 2010 Pro Bowl after Jonathan Vilma's New Orleans Saints qualified for Super Bowl XLIV, the first Pro Bowl selection in his career. Fletcher was also one of three candidates for the 2009 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which was ultimately won by the Kansas City Chiefs's Brian Waters.

After the Redskins' switch to a 3–4 defensive scheme, Fletcher moved from the middle linebacker position to the left inside linebacker for the 2010 season. He made the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive time in 2010, where he had an interception which set up a touchdown for the NFC.

Despite not making the 2012 Pro Bowl starting roster, Fletcher led the entire league in tackles with 166 tackles by the end of the 2011 season. He started all 16 games of the 2011 season and recorded 166 combined tackles, 1.5 sacks, two interceptions, and eight pass breakups. Fletcher, however, did make it as alternate for the 2012 Pro Bowl along with teammates, Brian Orakpo and Lorenzo Alexander. On January 9, 2012, Fletcher was added to the NFC 2012 Pro Bowl roster after Brian Urlacher confirmed that he would not be participating.
On January 11, 2012, it was announced that Fletcher won the Bart Starr Award. He was also named the Redskins' 2011 Defensive Player of the Year.

On April 13, 2012, Fletcher was re-signed by the Redskins to a two-year contract worth $10.75 million with $5.25 million guaranteed. He was given the 87th ranking in the NFL Network's Top 100 Players of 2012 list. Despite the Redskins' 31–28 loss to the St. Louis Rams in Week 2 of the 2012 season, Fletcher had a stellar performance. In the game, he intercepted quarterback Sam Bradford in the endzone and forced running back Daryl Richardson to fumble in the fourth quarter and the ball was recovered by DeAngelo Hall, which gave the Redskins one last attempt to tie or win the game. In the Week 12 win against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, he recorded his second interception for the season making him one of three active NFL players, at that time, to have recorded 20 interceptions and 30 sacks, the other two being Brian Urlacher and Ray Lewis.
Fletcher intercepted Joe Flacco in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. He had another interception, against Brandon Weeden, in the Redskins' win over the Cleveland Browns. He finished the season with 139 tackles, three sacks, and a career-high five interceptions.

There was doubt over whether Fletcher would return for the 2013 season until it was announced that he had surgery on his left ankle and was scheduled for elbow surgery to prepare for another season with the Redskins on March 6, 2013. On November 7, Fletcher started his 208th consecutive game, tying the league's all-time record of most starts by a linebacker last held by retired linebacker Derrick Brooks.

Retirement
On December 18, 2013, Fletcher announced his retirement. Fletcher finished his career having played in 256 consecutive games and starting 215 consecutive games, which is the NFL all-time record of consecutive starts at the linebacker position. He joined Washington's radio broadcast crew in 2022. On September 1, 2022, Fletcher was inducted into Washington's Greatest Players list in honor of the franchise's 90th anniversary.

Personal life
Fletcher and his wife Charne have three children, two daughters, Paige and Brooke, and a son, Steele.

Fletcher is a Christian. Fletcher spoke about his conversion to Christianity saying, ""I spent years chasing things I thought would bring me everlasting joy and happiness: chasing Super Bowl rings or a multi-million dollar contract; or a new house, cars and jewelry. None of those things did for me what Christ did in an instant.""

Fletcher was named a Pro Bowl alternate 11 times during his career and did not play in his first one until the 2010 Pro Bowl via replacing Jonathan Vilma. As a result, Fletcher called himself the NFL version of Susan Lucci, who won a Daytime Emmy after 19 nominations.
